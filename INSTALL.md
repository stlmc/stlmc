## Using the VirtualBox Image

You can run the experiments using VirtualBox (www.virtualbox.org). 

A Vritualbox image 'stlmc-artifact.ova' contains the benchmark models and scripts for the experiments. 
You can download the image from https://www.dropbox.com/home/ase2021.

A minimum system requirement is a dual-core machine with 2048 MB memory. In the virtual machine, 
our artifact is located in the directory 'home/user/ase2021'. The password of the image is "ase2021".
