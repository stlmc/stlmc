## Syntactic separation of signal temporal logic 

Running these scripts requires the following libraries:

1. [Z3 Python api](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)
2. [ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/) for Python 3

Below is a brief description of some script files:

- [run.py](run.py): runs all benchmarks and generates results.
- [model.py](model.py): generates an SMT encoding of benchmarks from an initial set up to a given bound.
