## STLmc

STLmc is an SMT-based bounded model checker for signal temporal logic (STL) of hybrid systems. The algorithm of the tool is refutationally complete for STL properties of bounded signals.

### Features

* Bounded model checking
* Generating trajectories that falsify the given STL properties if any exists
* Supporting various SMT solvers (e.g., Z3, Yices2, dReal3)
